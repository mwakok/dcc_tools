# Add a CONTRIBUTING file

We should add a CONTRUTING.md file containing instructions for:

- Asking a question
- Reporting a bug
- Make changes to the code
- Release a new version

Some guidelines can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors)
