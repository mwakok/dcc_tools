- [ ]
- [ ] Integration or build test
- [ ] User installation test
- [ ] Unit tests (coverage >70%)
- [ ] Continuous integration (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Code coverage check ([Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/), [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/), [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com/))

## Steps

- [ ] Reorganise the source code into a python package
- [ ] Write an integration test for a single script
- [ ] Refactor the single script and write unit tests for each refactored function
